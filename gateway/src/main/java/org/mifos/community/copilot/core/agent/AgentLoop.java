/**
 * The Copilot brain: LLM turn -> tool calls -> feed results back, until the model answers in
 * prose. Framework-free by design so the mentor's Fineract plugin can host it unchanged.
 *
 * <p>Banking invariants enforced HERE, not in the model (ADR-001 §04):
 * <ul>
 *   <li>default-deny, so a tool absent from the manifest is refused, whatever the model says;</li>
 *   <li>every WRITE pauses: the loop stores a single-use approval and streams an action_card,
 *       ending the turn WITHOUT a done event; execution happens only via {@link #resume};</li>
 *   <li>the approval card is built from the PARSED function call, never from model prose;</li>
 *   <li>at most {@link #MAX_TOOL_ROUNDS} tool rounds per turn, so no runaway loops;</li>
 *   <li>tool results feed the model, but rule custody stays in the system prompt.</li>
